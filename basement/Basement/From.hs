-- Flexible Type convertion
--
-- From is multi parameter type class that allow converting
-- from a to b.
--
-- Only type that are valid to convert to another type
-- should be From instance; otherwise TryFrom should be used.
--
-- Into (resp TryInto) allows the contrary instances to be able
-- to specify the destination type before the source. This is
-- practical with TypeApplication
